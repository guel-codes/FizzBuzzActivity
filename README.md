# FizzBuzzActivity
 FizzBuzz is a program that takes in a list of numbers and outputs the result of Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz depending on if the number in the list is divisible by 3,5 or 3 & 5 respectively. 


## Files created
- helpers.py
- fizzbuzz.py

## Usage
```python 
INPUT: my_list = [1,2,3,5,7,9,15,30]
OUTPUT: 1,2,Fizz,Buzz,7,Fizz,FizzBuzz,FizzBuzz           
``` 
## Insight:
For testing purposes I made the list of numbers in the fizzbuzz.py file instead of asking for user input. This functionality can be added later for a user to input a list of numbers.
# Requirements/Tests:
- Prints "Fizz" for numbers in list divisible by 3
- Prints "Buzz" for numbers in list divisible by 5
- Prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers in list divisible by 3 & 5
- Prints out numbers if it is not divisible by 3,5 or 3 & 5
